[00:02.09] Do you realize this country has just witnessed
[00:04.09] The greatest crash, and
[00:06.17] The greatest depression
[00:07.75] We haven't done so bad
[00:18.75] 
[00:09.40] No heroes are allowed to enter
[00:14.53] No heroes are allowed to enter
[00:19.64] No heroes are allowed to enter

[00:28.49] No heroes
[00:32.99] 
[00:47.68] I don't get it
[00:54.68] 
[00:48.30] No heroes are allowed to enter
[00:53.19] No heroes are allowed to enter
[00:56.76] We have drawn the line
[00:58.34] No heroes are allowed to enter
[01:03.09] No hero-oes

[01:11.29] 
[01:07.53] Presently
[01:08.30] We noticed the gaunt features of
[01:11.06] Something else watching him
[01:13.59] From the darkest point of your emotions
[01:33.09] 
[01:16.47] No heroes
[01:20.97] 
[01:25.79] I agree with you
[01:33.79] 
[01:34.94] Alien invaders
[01:36.20] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
[01:45.21] Triangle
[01:49.21] 
[02:05.49] No heroes are allowed to enter
[02:10.21] No heroes are allowed to enter
[02:14.93] No heroes are allowed to enter
[02:19.61] No hero-o-oes
[02:26.11] 
[02:42.93] No heroes
[02:47.43] 
[03:02.15] I don't get it
[03:02.60] No heroes are allowed to enter
[03:07.42] No heroes are allowed to enter
[03:12.22] No heroes are allowed to enter
[03:17.25] No hero-o-oes
[03:23.75] 
[03:41.72] Noo-o-o
[03:45.36] No heroes
[03:50.30] Kick it
